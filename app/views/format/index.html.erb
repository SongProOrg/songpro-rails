<h1>SongPro Format</h1>

<p class="lead">A guide for writing songs using the SongPro format</p>

<p>A SongPro file can contain Attributes, Custom Attributes, Sections, Lyrics &amp; Chords, Tablature, Measures and Comments.</p>

<h3>Attributes</h3>

<p>Attributes are added with the format:</p>

<pre class="border p-2"><code>@attribute=value
</code></pre>

<p>You can specify the following song attributes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>title</li>
  <li>artist</li>
  <li>capo</li>
  <li>key</li>
  <li>tempo</li>
  <li>year</li>
  <li>album</li>
  <li>tuning</li>
</ul>

<p>They can be placed anywhere in the song but it&rsquo;s recommended to put them at the top of your file.
  The values are text that are displayed in the rendered output.</p>

<h3>Custom Attributes</h3>

<p>Custom attributes can be added the format:</p>

<pre class="border p-2"><code>!custom_attribute=value
</code></pre>

<p>A custom attribute can be anything. These are mainly used by other apps that want to store additional attributes
  beyond the core set or are specific to the app.</p>

<h3>Sections</h3>

<p>Any line starting with <code>#</code> is considered the beginning of a new section:</p>

<pre class="border p-2"><code># Section Name
</code></pre>

<p>Section names are usually things like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verse 1</li>
  <li>Chorus 2</li>
  <li>Bridge</li>
  <li>Outro</li>
</ul>

<p>But you can name them however you please.</p>

<h3>Lyrics &amp; Chords</h3>

<p>Chords are anything contained inside of brackets, such as <code>C#m7</code>. Lyrics are words by themselves or around
  chords.</p>

<pre class="border p-2"><code>You&#39;ll be [Asus4]safe in [A7]here
</code></pre>

<h3>Tablature</h3>

<p>Any line starting with <code>|-</code> is considered to be tablature. For example:</p>

<pre class="border p-2"><code>|-8--10--12--10--8-|
</code></pre>

<h3>Measures</h3>

<p>When you want to show where chord changes are for an instrumental section, start a line with <code>|</code> and use
  another <code>|</code> whenever a new measure starts.</p>

<pre class="border p-2"><code>| [G] | [D] | [F#] | [Bm] [D/A] |
</code></pre>

<h3>Comments</h3>

<p>You can include comments throughout the song by prefixing them with <code>&gt;</code>. These can be used to provide
  performance notes/tips to players.</p>

<pre class="border p-2"><code>&gt; Whistle the verse melody over these chords
</code></pre>
